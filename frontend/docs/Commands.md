# Commands

Many of the commands of the bot take parameters to control what they do.
Commands parameters are separated by spaces (' '). If a parameter you are using
contains a space (i.e. a name like "Bot Commander") use double quotes (") to
tell the bot it is a single parameter.

To see

  username/discriminator.

- `channel(s)` - Can be a channel's mention, name, or ID.

?> Permissions, unless specified otherwise, that both the bot and the calling
